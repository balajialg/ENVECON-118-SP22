    "Kiel and McClain (1995) studied the effect that a new garbage incinerator had on housing values in North Andover, Massachusetts. We have two years of data: 1978, when there was just a rumor that an incinerator was going to be built, and 1981, when the location for the incinerator had been chosen and construction began. You might think that the prices of houses located close to the new incinerator would be affected. \n",
