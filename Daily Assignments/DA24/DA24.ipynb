    "\n",
    "This data set `APPLE.dta` in Wooldridge is an interesting example of experimental data (it can suggest ideas for future projects). They are telephone survey data attempting to elicit the demand for a (fictional) ecologically-friendly apple. Each family was randomly presented with a set of prices for regular apples and eco-labeled apples. They were asked how many pounds of each kind of apple they would buy. The data set includes the following variables:\n",
