    "This exercise should be completed using R. Remember, when you want an output to show in the notebook, you need to *explicitly* call the object in your R code. For example, if you want to show the mean oairline fare, you can't just type `MeanFare <- mean(fare)`, because that will just save the output to `MeanFare`. Instead, you need to then type `MeanFare` on its own so it displays the output. **Answers that do not display the desired output will be graded as incorrect.**\n",
