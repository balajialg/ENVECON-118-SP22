The researcher ran the following regression, where $Y_d$ = the log of stock price of the major vaccine manufacturer on day d. The researcher has N=500 days of data. $\\log(Number~Cases)_d$ is the log of daily COVID-19 cases in the country, and $FDA_d$ is a dummy variable equal to one if the FDA approves vaccinations for children under 12, and equal to zero otherwise.
